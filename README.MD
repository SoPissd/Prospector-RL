Ideas for [Prospector](http://www.prospector.at/forum/), a roguelike written by Magellan.

As I don't expect contributions here, expect this fork to get blown away if and as I rewrite its history to integrate Magellan's new [svn releases](https://code.google.com/p/rlprospector/source/list).

Browse the history to see how this code differs from mainline. That's the point of the repo. Enjoy!
